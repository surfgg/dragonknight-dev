        <p>
            Dragon Knight is an open source text-based RPG written in PHP. It was originally a passion project by
            a developer known as <a href="http://jaminblount.com">Jamin Blount</a> (also as <a href="http://se7enet.com">Renderse7en</a>),
            and was written in PHP4.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4">
            The game's source code was given out, and the project abandoned. Jamin Blount uploaded the code to
            <a href="https://github.com/renderse7en/dragon-knight">Github</a> in 2007. He stated in the readme that
            he would make no updates, and not even check on Issues or Pull Requests.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4">
            Fast forward 3 years, and in 2010 a rookie web developer known as <a href="https://github.com/splashsky">Splashsky</a>
            found the abandoned source code, and learned to program in PHP with it. Another 10 years, and now he is reviving the project
            for the benefit of any other rookie PHP developers who might glean usefulness from it as he did.
